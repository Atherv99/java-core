Ques: When constructor is creating?
Answer: When object is creating.

constructor should have required, 
every class minimum one constructor.

compiler provided default constructor, 
that is no arg constructor if no constructor is there.

we can develop any number of constructor.

Ques: When subclass is abstract class?

constructor can be created in abstract class.
every class should have minimum one constructor whether abstract class, 
otherwise compiler will give error.
