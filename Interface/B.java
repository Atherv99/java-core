interface B
{
}

/*
interface is fully abstract class.

in order to achieve 100% abstractness we use interface.

we can not declared sib iib and constructor.

by default every interface is abstract so abstract keyword is optional.

inside of interface body no concreteness is allowed.

in the body of interface only two type of member is allowed 
one is constant
second one is abstract method

every member of interface is public by default.

we cant develop the private or protected explicitly.

the default access level is public, only we can use public access level.

by default interface is not public, only members are public.

compiler generate the class file of interface.
